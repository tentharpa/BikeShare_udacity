# BikeShare_udacity 

## Project Overview
This is a project focused on Data Visualization of bike rides from a certain location to it destination. It considers factors like age, gender and user type when performing the visualization

## The Dataset: 
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- Stop Time and Date
- Start Station Name
- End Station Name
- Station ID
- Station Lat/Long
- Bike ID
- User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
- Gender (unknown; male;female)
- Year of Birth

## Univariate Visualization
- The visualization showed two distinct peaks at the office start and end hour. This tells us that, majority of the bikers are office goers.
- Another finding showed that "Market St at 10th St" is the busisest location.

## Bivariate VIsualization
- Here, we found that majority of the riders were male between the age of 30 to 40

## Multivariate Visualization
- Age and Gender tend to be uniform for all riders around 30 to 40. No significant difference between the male and female.

## Key Insights / Findings
- It was interesting to see that majoirty of the bike-share riders were subscribers rather than customers type. The subscibers have an annual pass while the customers have a three day pass.  This would mean that people are using these bikes on a regularly routine basis and for some serious work, not just biking for fun.
This is complemented by my finding in the univariate plot where we see two distinct plots right at the beginning of office hours and end of the office hours.
- My visualization depicts the busiest stations in terms of the bike rider, this could help the bikeshare company come up more business applications and also ways to decrease the traffic.
