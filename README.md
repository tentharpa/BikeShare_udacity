## Project Overview
This is a project focused on Data Visualization of bike rides from a certain location to it destination. It considers factors like age, gender and user type when performing the visualization

## The Dataset: 
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- Stop Time and Date
- Start Station Name
- End Station Name
- Station ID
- Station Lat/Long
- Bike ID
- User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
- Gender (unknown; male;female)
- Year of Birth

## Univariate Visualization
- The visualization showed two distinct peaks at the office start and end hour. This tells us that, majority of the bikers are office goers.
- Another finding showed that "Market St at 10th St" is the busisest location.

## Bivariate VIsualization
- Here, we found that majority of the riders were male between the age of 30 to 40

## Multivariate Visualization
- Age and Gender tend to be uniform for all riders around 30 to 40. No significant difference between the male and female.
